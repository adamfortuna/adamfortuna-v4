  %p
    For a long time I've been writing down goals. I think it started with new
    years resolutions, then it became monthly resolutions. Lately I've been
    doing monthly goals where I list out my top 25 goals and organize them by
    priority, then pick a few to tackle for the month. On the first of any
    month, I'll probably be doing this.

  %h2 Career Related
  %p I have a lot of internal goals at Code School that don't make sense to chat about, but there is one external one that I'm passionate about.
