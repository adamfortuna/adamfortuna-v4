  %p Here's a few areas of my life are my major focuses.

    I like to document and organize my
    %a{href: '/about/goals'} Goals
    â€“ somewhat obsessively. I've been doing these on my own in Evernote for a

    = succeed '.' do
      %a{href: '/about/orlando'} Orlando

    read.

    Since April 2011, I've been happily working at
    %a{href: '/about/codeschool'} Code School
    working on educational content in the coding world. It's been the job

    In 2014 I finally bought a "good" camera and taking lots of

      %a{href: '/photos'} photos
    These include anything from trips to
