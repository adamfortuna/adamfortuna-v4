This last week has gone by entirely too fast. Coding, going out, Micheal Moore, HK movies, classes and massive amounts of work. Last week hit me hard too — 38 hours in a week most my HW was due. There's no longer any doubt though. The time i spend working out is inverse related to the time spent coding. There's just no way around it. If someone finds a hack for this relationship, please let me know. So what've I been doing…

-   Messing around with [PEAR] packages
-   Adding Amazon DVD results to that movies script on Dymension (obviously not to make money; but just so i know how to do it)
-   FB4-ing Dymension to get it ready for multiple user support (just for the hell of it)
-   Reading dedicated server, php5 and mysql5 articles
-   Working with WHM's cgi scripts to automatically create hosting accounts
-   Working on another website I'll probably never complete, so I won't take the time to mention it

Things I'd like to do…

-   Finish what i've started above. There's a handful of websites I really want to work on. I just need to concentrate on 1 and stick it out. Maybe i'll try to make a project timeline and prioritize these things.
-   Think of an insanely cool, attract everyone kind of website. (well, i'd *like* to)

Eh, anyways; as someone i talked to today mention I should be trying out the things I want to do while i'm still ‘young'. While I don't feel any older than I was yesterday (or last year for that matter), with graduation around the corner I guess it makes me think about it a little more. I'll see if I can try a few new things before I say my farewells to college life in December.
