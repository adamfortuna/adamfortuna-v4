I've always been a [Prototype] advocate. Not for any deep down reason for how it compares with [jQuery] though, mostly because I was interested in learning Ruby on Rails and it happend to be the library of choice. With [version 1.0 of jQuery hitting the shelves] over the weekend, it's a good time to reevluate the reasoning behind this. Luckily there's great posts out there advocating both [for prototype] and [Why jQuery's Philosophy is Better] . Interesting food for thought. Look forward to reading over jQuery 1.0's source.
