## Designing the Obvious

[Designing the Obvious](http://rhjr.net/shorty/amazon/dto) is a book I ran into at Books a Million a few months ago. Usually when I head out to bookstores I grab a handful of books and end up scanning over them for tips, maybe reading a few relevant chapters, then putting it back. Very rarely do I end up reading through the entire book at one sitting at the bookstore. That's just what happened with Designing the Obvious. After reading through the entire book I put it back on the shelf as usual. On a second trip to the same bookstore later I ended up reviewing most the book, gleaming new shreds of information from each chapter. Rarely have I spent so much time on a book, better yet seen relevant bits a second time through. Eventually I ordered it from Amazon and have re-read most of it since then. If you want to check out a sample chapter from the book, it's available for free on [the authors website](http://rhjr.net/dto/) .

## Designing the Moment

The author, [Robert Hoekman, Jr.](http://rhjr.net) , also has a second book coming out just this week called [Designing the Moment](http://rhjr.net/shorty/amazon/dtm) which seems to pickup with more concrete examples and run with them. \_ Obvious\_ was more general in what you want the user to think and what you want to convey in your app, while *Moment* seems to be more about analyzing actual examples. Anyone interested in creating kick-ass interfaces that people love to use should consider reading both of these. \_ Moment\_ comes out this week, so it's a good time to grab one or both if it's a topic you enjoy. Like *Obvious* , there's a sample chapter on [the authors website](http://rhjr.net/dtm/) .
