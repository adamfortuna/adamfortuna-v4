Lately I've been searching for and trying to listen to more technical podcasts. It's a great time for podcasts right now, with more high quality technical podcasts available than ever before. I'm always looking for more recommendations, but here are a few that I've been listening to lately.

### General Programming

[Ruby 5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/) - Quick look at what's going on in the Ruby world.
[The Ruby Show](http://rubyshow.com/) - Longer look at the Ruby world with some good humor thrown in.
[Stack Exchange Podcast](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/) - As a long time read of both [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) and [Jeff's](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) blogs, I'm very happy to see this podcast come back after a long hiatus.
[This Developers Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) - A look at developer stories told in a similar way to [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/).
[The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) - Focuses on the new projects and tools, usually by interviewing the authors.
[Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/) - Very long running podcast with a Microsoft tilt, but covering a wide range of development.

### Non-Programming, but Science, Math, Technology related

[Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) - After reading Merlin Mann's blog for years, and hearing him speak at IzeaFest, it's great to hear him talk.
[The Talk Show](http://thetalkshow.net/) - By the respected Apple writer [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/).
[Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomicsradio.com/category/listen/podcasts) - A new look at old statistics.
[Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) - Entertaining science focused stories. Huge archive, but worth going back and listening to every one.

### Already Popular

[Dinner Party Download](http://www.publicradio.org/columns/dinnerpartydownload/) - Fast and funny "booster shot" of news and culture.
[Wait Wait Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/) - Hilarious take on the weeks news.
[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) - Storytelling at it's best on the radio.
[The Moth Podcast](http://themoth.org/) - Live stories told on stage. Usually they are hilarious, and no two are the same.
[NPR: Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=127413729) - All the financial news you really need, usually told through stories and people.

### Recommendations Welcome

There are only so many podcasts that I can listen to in a day before jumping back to music, but this mix of different categories has kept me entertained for a while now. Are there any podcasts that you love and listen to as soon as you can?
