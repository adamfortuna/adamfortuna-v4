After a few months of hard (but fun) work, we launched my latest Code School course -- [Blasting Off with Bootstrap](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/blasting-off-with-bootstrap)! If you're not familiar with Bootstrap, it's a super simple to get started with and allows you to skip past many of the initial steps and concentrate on creating something.

This is the first course that I've been on camera for, which was a terrifying experience. I'm extremely happy with how the course turned out. Much of what I taught in the course was learned building this blog in Bootstrap. If you're interested, you can play the first level for free and get a feel for the content.
