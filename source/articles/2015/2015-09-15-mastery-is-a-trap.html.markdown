A few weeks ago at Code School, we did a 3 day long [hack event](https://www.codeschool.com/blog/2015/09/04/code-school-culture-hack-days/) where we formed into small teams and tackled whatever were were most passionate about working on. During this time, I was pairing with a coworker and they asked a question that I've heard a number of times before (paraphrased):

> How long will it take for be able to program like that?

This is a question that mentors, teachers and anyone who is sharing knowledge gets from time to time that is tough to answer. It felt great to know that my coworker respected my experience and was asking for advice -- but when it came to answering the question, I had no good response. Do I mention how long it took me to get there? Do I try to find and suggest a shortcut based on what I've learned? What is a good answer to this question?

## The Piano Teacher

A few day later, I was listening to an audiobook, [The Practicing Mind](/books), when a very similar conversation came up -- but this time between a piano student (the "I" in the following quote) and a piano teacher (Don).

> After one of my lessons, Don started playing around on the piano as I was packing up my music. I had never met anyone who played the piano as well as he did. He had earned his ability with years of a solid practice ethic, working at the piano sometimes seven to eight hours a day.
>
> While he was playing, Don told me that he felt that if he didn’t start working harder, he would never get really good on the piano. I was shocked by his casual remark.
>
> I commented that if I could play the piano as well as he could, I would be content to do nothing all day long but listen to myself play. He looked at me and smiled. “You know, Tom, that is exactly what I said to my teacher years ago when I first heard him play.”
>
> Don had studied with a world-renowned classical and jazz pianist. I had heard recordings of his teacher, who was extremely accomplished. Still, it occurred to me that if someone could reach Don’s level of playing ability and still feel unfulfilled, I was going to have to rethink both my motivations for studying the instrument and my need to reach some level of "perfection" in order to become fulfilled.

This short exchange hit me on many levels. In some areas of life I'm the teacher, but in many more I'm the student -- testing the waters to gauge how much effort will be required to make it to a destination.

This destination driven approach to learning (as well as travel, writing and most anything) puts the mind into the wrong place for making the most of an opportunity. Rather than being in the moment and learning, I know I can get caught in the trap of having a destination. It's something that once conscience of can be corrected. When I am, it helps me step back and instead try to figure out a way to enjoy what I'm doing.

When it comes to programming, what is the difference between the student, the teacher and the master? At each level, there are similarities -- they learn by experience, deliberate practice and challenging themselves to be better.

## Practice and Habit

@pull right
The goal of practice is discovery through enjoyment -- not mastery.

Practice is just as important in programming as in learning Piano. How you practice and how often will have more of an affect on your productivity than anything else. Practice could be [watching Pluralsight videos](http://pluralsight.com), [taking Code School Courses](https://www.codeschool.com), reading books, working on side projects, doing programming exercises -- or other things.

The times when I have learned the most in life are when I have a side project.

For me, practice has always been working on side projects. I've created numerous failed websites, blogs and tools. Each of which had a short term goal in mind (creating the site) as well as an immediate goal (a specific page in the site). To accomplish each immediate goal, I might jump over and watch videos to help me learn about something I'm having an issue with.

When interviewing developers, the number one thing I always look for is a curiosity that leads them to learning and accomplishing their goals. It shows that they have learned how to perform deliberate practice, which is a very difficult skill to acquire. It also shows they know to accomplish their goals.

## Habit

Getting into a habit for practice is tough. __The Practicing Mind__ and __The Power of Habit__ (obviously) touch on this topic a lot. Both books mention the importance of using practice as a habit, as well as finding a way to make it an enjoyable process. I was lucky enough to stumble into this for programming (side projects), but in other areas in life I haven't always been that lucky.

About a year ago, I gave up on practicing piano. It was something I've always wanted to do (and may yet go back to), but I wasn't able to find a way to enjoy practice. At the time I didn't realize that was the issue -- I just felt I wasn't having fun or getting better. What I hadn't done was find a way for myself to enjoy practice.

### The Gym Analogy

Exercise on a consistent basis is practice. After putting on the freshman 15 (ok, more like 40) in college, I decided it was time to start exercising. I wanted to look better, so I went to the gym. The habit didn't stick for me. I was approaching with a goal in mind, and overlooked finding a way to enjoy the journey there.

It wasn't until many years later when I started going to the gym with friends, and later making friends there that it fell into a habit without me realizing it.

## Time Commitment

Developing mastery of anything takes an exceedingly long time. Becoming proficient in something, however, can usually be done with far less commitment. I've found that I enjoy this early learning and exploration much more, and for a wider set of skills, than developing mastery. It's the difference between becoming proficient enough to teach a topic and becoming the main source for knowledge that every teacher in the world wants to go to.

I'd much rather be the piano teacher, able to spend time playing whenever I want, rather than the concert pianist, saddled with perfection and an audience.

## The Craftsman Mindset

The whole [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) thing has taken off in the programming world a lot in the last decade. I owe a lot of my own growth as a developer to adopting this approach to creating software. There's something about believing in something bigger than you that has an impact on you perceive your own abilities, strengths and limits. Even as an atheist, I could feel the tug of community which drew me see my profession as something more than a person who makes websites.

If you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend [The Practical Programmer](), [The Mythical Man Month](), [Joel on Software]() and [Peopleware]() -- all beautiful books. _The Mythical Man Month_ contains one of my favorite quotes about programming:

> There is a delight in working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
[The Mythical Man-Month](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959)

Doesn't that make you feel in awe of what you can do as a programmer? I know it did to me. Even in these works though, there is a heavy focus on creation, imagination and shipping. The craftsman mindset to me is much more associated with shipping than anything else in our industry. A woodworker who learns how to carve a specific shape perfectly, but never puts that skill to use building something is the same to me as a programmer master who doesn't use those skills to do something they want to do.

## Know Where You're Going

When you read the piano teacher story, who did you identify with? Is there something in your life where you would qualify as someone else? For me
