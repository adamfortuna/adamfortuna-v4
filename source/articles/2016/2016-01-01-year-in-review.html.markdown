This is my annual recap of what's happened in my life over the last year. This year had a major focus on travel at home and helping to grow a team at work. There were many memorable trips throughout the year, and a much more active social calendar than most years. As an introvert, this has been fun, but exhausting.

The biggest themes for my year were: Code School, travel, blogging again, health focus and video games. After years of not playing too many video games, this year I picked up a Wii U and a PS4 which have both been a ton of fun.

## So What's this All About?

For the last 5 years, I've been reflecting on the major events of the past year when a new one starts. Here's a few of these:

* [2014 Year in Review]()
* [2013 Year in Review]()

So, let's see what made the list as interesting from this year!

## Travel

This year had a big push for more travel. This led to the [Travel or Vacation?](/articles/travel-or-vacation) article from earlier this year.
