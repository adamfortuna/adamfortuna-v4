This is my annual recap of what's happened in my life over the last year. This year had a major focus on travel. Somehow I ended up doing on quite a few memorable trips throughout the year. As an introvert, this has been fun, but exhausting.

The biggest themes for my year were: Code School, travel, blogging again, health focus, cocktails, video games and personal organization. After years of not playing too many video games, this year I picked up a Wii U and a PS4 which have both been a ton of fun.

## So What's this All About?

For the last 5 years, I've been reflecting on the major events of the past year when a new one starts. Here's a few of these:

* [2014 Year in Review](/articles/2014-year-in-review)
* [2013 Year in Review](/articles/2013-year-in-review)
* [2012 Year in Review](/articles/2012-year-in-review)
* [2011 Year in Review](/articles/2011-year-in-review)
* [2010 Year in Review](/articles/2010-year-in-review)

So, let's see what made the list as interesting from this year!

## Travel

This year had a big push for more travel. This led to the [Travel or Vacation?](/articles/travel-or-vacation) article from earlier this year.

* [Rome for a Week](/photos/rome/a-week-in-rome) - With Marilyn for her work trip
* Amsterdam for a few days in January.
* Salt Lake City for the Pluralsight Authors Summit & ng-conf.

* Sarasota - For the Code School retreat
