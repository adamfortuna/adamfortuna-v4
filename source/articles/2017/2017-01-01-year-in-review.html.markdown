2016 was a weird year. Politics and celebrity deaths aside, it was bumpy year for me as well. Things were well at home, but at work, I went through some transitions that stretched me very thin and stressed me out for much of the year.

The biggest overall themes for me year were: Product at Code School, travel, books & comics, minimalism and self reflection. That sounds a bit broad, but the idea is really just taking a look at what makes me happy and healthy and working on that.

## So What's this All About?

I've been doing this post every year. It's a good way for me to reflect on where I thought I wanted to go a year ago and make sure I'm heading to the right place. There's a few past years for comparison: [2015](/articles/2015-year-in-review),
[2014](/articles/2014-year-in-review), [2013](/articles/2013-year-in-review), [2012](/articles/2012-year-in-review), [2011](/articles/2011-year-in-review) and [2010](/articles/2010-year-in-review).

What's been notable this past year?

## Travel

Only one of our trips this year was international (compared to 3 in 2015), making travel a lot less stressful this year. Most of our trips were more relaxed -- with the exception of the 30,000 steps we took on our first day in NYC.

* Went to [Helsinki, Finland](/photos/finland/helsinki), [Estonia](/photos/tallinn/estonia) and [Germany](/photos/germany/travel) and ate so many amazing things.
* Spent a few days in **Portland** and **Seattle** with friends for the 4th of July.
* Week long stay in **Salt Lake City** to learn about product from the lovely people at Pluralsight.
* Headed to **Puerto Rico** for a Wedding Anniversary and toured some of the island in August.
* Code School retreat at **Hammock Beach Resort** on the Atlantic coast.
* **St. Petersburg** for Crab Fest with friends.
* **New York City** for family time, a Magnetic Fields concert and seeing Hamilton.
* **Colorado Springs** trip with Code School friends.
