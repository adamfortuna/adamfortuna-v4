Like all blogs these days, I decided to add a favicon recently. In case my Photoshop skills needs interpretation, what you're looking at are the letters af tied together. It's actually a lot easier to recognize this in the larger version. Still plan on adding something up top, as it's looking a little barren, but that'll come soon. The logo itself is the Coldfusion icon, with the curves copied to create the a in the same style. Not a bad first attempt for someone who considers himself completely useless in Photoshop.
