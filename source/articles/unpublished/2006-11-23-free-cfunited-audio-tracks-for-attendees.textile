For a few months Teratech has offered downloads of the CFunited sessions videos on their site for a fee, with one sample video free to anyone. Now, however, attendees can download the mp3s of each session as well! I'm definitely looking forward to hearing a lot of the tracks I wasn't able to make it to. If you went to CFUnited this year, "check it out":http://www.teratech.com/cfunited06/ .
