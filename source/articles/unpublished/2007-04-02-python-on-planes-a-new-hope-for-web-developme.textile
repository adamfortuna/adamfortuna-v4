As much as I love ColdFusion, "Python On Planes":http://pythononplanes.com/ looks like a great new solution. It brands itself as:

bq(posterous_short_quote). Python on Planes is an open-source web framework that's optimized for python happiness and snakeable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring snake oil over gems.

It sounds like it could be wildly successful. Get in now and be one of the early adopters!

bq(posterous_medium_quote). Planes is the most well thought-out snake oil framework I've ever sniffed. And that's in a decade of doing tongue forking for a living. I've built my own snakes, helped develop the Snakes API, and have created more than a few snakepits from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.- Vladimir Putin
