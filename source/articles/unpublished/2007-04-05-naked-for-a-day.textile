Yes, April 5th is Naked day. I'm not suggesting going to work like that, but consider dropping your stylesheets for the day. "Dustin Diaz":http://www.dustindiaz.com/ appears to be leading the initiative with over 1400 sites already going buff today. I have to admit, since I use WordPress I hadn't dug into the html, but seeing it now I'm impressed with it's layout. If you want to find out more, read about "Naked Day 2007 at Dustin Diaz.com":http://naked.dustindiaz.com/ . Now I'm realizing one thing though -- I really should probably fix the size of the comment textarea box, which appears to be set entirely in CSS.
