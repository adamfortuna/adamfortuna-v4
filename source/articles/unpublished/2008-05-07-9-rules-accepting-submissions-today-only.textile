If you've ever noticed that little leaf on my sidebar, you're probably familiar with "9 Rules":http://www.9rules.com . 9 Rules is a community of bloggers focused on, you guessed it, 9 Rules. These are available in their "about page":http://9rules.com/about/ , but the focus is to _Love what you do_ and _Never stop learning_ . If you're even reading this blog you'll probably qualify for both of these. If you have a blog, why not submit it to 9 Rules this round? I'm amazed at some of the new blogs that have been accepted this round already including "Zen Habits":http://zenhabits.net/ , "Unclutterer":http://unclutterer.com/ and "Smashing Magazine":http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ -- 3 blogs I already follow. Don't think you need 100,000 RSS subscribers or even 100 to join though -- they accept based on content and dedication. I'm looking forward to seeing if I "stay in":http://www.adamfortuna.com/2006/12/30/one-more-new-member-of-9rules/ in what looks like a very fast growing and dedicated blogosphere.
