Marilyn and I dressed up to attend The Great Orlando Mixer — a 20s themed event at the Cheyenne Saloon here in Orlando. The concept? 20s themed clothes, entertainment and cocktails. 8 different locations from around Orlando came together to create unique cocktails for the event that everyone could try and vote on.

## Dressed to the 20s

The Cheyenne Saloon is an amazing place for this — with 3 levels to sit at and watch the show below. The event brought in a number of distilleries including St. Augustine and Templeton Rye.
