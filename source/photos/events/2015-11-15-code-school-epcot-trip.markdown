Every fall, Code School takes an group trip over Epcot for their Food and Wine festival. The tradition started even before I joined [Envy](http://madewithenvy.com/), but this makes 5 years of group fun. This year our crew totaled about 41 total joining in, with their optional +1's.

This year the night flew by faster than ever before. I'm lucky to work with such a great team of friends who I enjoy hanging out with -- at the office or anywhere.
