The guide from our Canal tour offered a very generous proposal -- he'd take us out into the Gamboa rainforest around sundown to walk around and experience what it's like at dusk. We gladly accepted!

## Culebra Cut

## Rainforest

We were able to wander around some before things got dark.

### Night

Eventually things got dark and we weren't able to see much.
