<!-- ## Panama Canal Tour

We started day 2 up before 6am to prepare for our tour. Our tour started early to get a jump on the day at a time when we would have the canal to ourselves and have our best chance at seeing animals.

__Driving to the canal__

## Pushing Off

Our guides took us to a little dock where the two of us, two guides and family of 4 loaded into small boat.

## The Water

Great views from the boat.

And great views of the coastline.

## Monkey Islands

When the area was flooded, the water rose, trapping some monkies.

### Capuchin Monkies

Our first stop was at a small island to see some capuchin monkies.

## San Lorenzo

On the way up to the Carribbean Sea, we passed by San Lorenzo, an abandoned town.

When we were also were able to walk some of the way to Fort something.

## Fort

On the Carribean side, we sat down for a quick bite to eat and toured the fort.

It overlooks the water and acts as a focal point for ships coming in.

## Gatun Locks

The 3 "Locks" are the engineering heart of the Panama Canal. These are the points where a ship enters, and is raised or lowered, then let free on the other side. Even though the Pacific and Atlantic are at sea level, due to tides and the rotation of the earth, the Atlantic is significantly higher than the Pacific. When traveling from Atlantic -> Pacific, this means the ships go down many meters.

### Open the Gates

Every few minutes another ship goes through the gates. We were able to hang out and watch a "Panamax" ship, a ship at the maximum size able to make it through the port.

We also were able to see some of the old trains used to move and stablize the ships as they made their way through the locks.

## Returning to Panama

After waving goodbye to the Disney Cruise Ship guests, we made our way back to our hotel, happily chatting with the French tourists (who had just been to Cuba!) for the hour long ride back to town. -->
