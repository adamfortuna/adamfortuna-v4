The city isn't that large, with the rainforest and the ocean holding it in. For tourists, the main sites of the city can be seen in a day or two. We concentrated on a few main areas for our stay: the Albrook Mall (where we were staying), Via Argentina Street, the waterfront and Casco Viejo.

## Via Argentina

This area has a few things.

We walked south all the way to the waterfront where we

## Waterfront

Lots going on at the waterfront.

We finished the night up with some ceviche and a pair of beers for $5.

## Casco Viejo

Casco Viejo is the "old city". If you've been to San Juan or even Key West it might look familiar. Small streets, little shops.

We made two unfortunate decisions with our timing. We were here the day before independence day, which meant a number of shops were shut down. The second mistake was that

We found some amazing at Bajarique Coffee Kitchen

### Casa Sucre

Wandering north, we found Casa Sucre, another small coffee house and cafe.

### Art

Nice amount of art around the city as well.

### The View from Outside

Like many nice neighborhoods, only a few blocks from Casco Viejo are some of the most run down parts of the city. Houses with tarps for roofs.



## Minimal Planning

This was the first trip that we opted not to organize our travel ahead of time.

## Local Expat Guides

Our tour guide was amazing. It made us realize how much we love having local guides that moved to the city for some reason other than work. Mike? Was previously from the midwest and moved to Panama with his Panamanian wife. The same goes for our Japan trip where we met another midwestern guide who moved there for a woman. There's something to locals who fall in love with the people and place and want to share it.

## Check for Holidays

Make sure you know about them to plan accordingly.

## Weather is Unpredictable

Leading up to our trip, it looked like it was going to rain everyday. In the end it only ever rained once or twice, and never when it mattered.

## Don't Rely on Yelp

Not all locations have a solid Yelp community. Although popular in the US, Canada and Europe, in Asian and Latin America you can't rely on it.

## Wifi Is (almost) Everywhere

Just about everywhere we went had wifi. I bought a minimal international data plan for the month, but ended up not using half of it. It did come in handy for using Uber though.

## Uber > Taxis

Every taxi we used was super-sleezy. Many don't have the required paperwork to do their job and live in fear of being pulled over. Ubers felt safe and we enjoyed them the entire time. To our surprise, a high number of our Uber drivers were women.

## Get Away from the City

The most memorial parts of our trip weren't the old city, the views of the harbor or the amazing meals, but the look out over the canal, or the sound of the rainforest at night. If we had to do the trip again, I'd probably leave the city sooner and more often.

## Would You Come Back?

I did enjoy the slower pace of the country and it's welcoming people. I would come back to Panama, but probably not to Panama City. We didn't get a chance to see the mountains, which would be amazing to check out next time.
