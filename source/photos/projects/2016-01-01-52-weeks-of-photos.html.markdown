Towards the end of 2015, I ran into a [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/3yozk2/looking_for_a_52_week_photo_challenge_for_2016_i/) that looked interesting -- 52 themed photos in 52 weeks. In an attempt to get better at photography, I'm going to give it a shot and update this post throughout the year with new photos each week(ish) with the theme.
