Just about anyone going to Rome for the first time will probably go to the Colosseum -- and we were no different. We booked a tour ahead of time and made plans to explore the area!

## Avoid the Lines

We pre-purchased tickets and a tour, which let us skip the huge line outside. I'd highly recommend getting your tickets this way and printing them out. Although the Vatican had no line in January, the Colosseum had one around the block.

## Guided Tours

There are 4 levels to the Colosseum, but only two of them can be accessed with a general ticket. To access the ground floor, where gladiators prepared themselves, and the top floor where the best views are, you'll need to buy a guided tour. These relatively cheap and leave every 15 minutes. Each tour will get certain areas of the Colosseum to themselves.

## Getting In

We did have a bit of an issue going in though. I brought my camera bag with me to take some photos, but they wouldn't let me in with it. Women are allowed to bring bags, but unfortunately not men. There are also no lockers nearby, so if you bring a bag, you're out of luck. I saw one guy hiding his backpack under a trash can because there was no other option.

We ended up transferring everything from my bag to my coat and pockets, then folding it up to cram it inside Marilyn's purse. They let us pass without an issue.

## Wandering Around

Once you're inside, there are two levels that you can access without a guide -- the middle ring (ground floor) and the 2nd floor. We missed the stairs up to the 2nd floor at first.
