Interested in adding OpenID to your wordpress blog? From Eran, the same guy who recently released a "MicroID Plugin for Wordpress":http://eran.sandler.co.il/2007/01/07/microid-plugin-for-wordpress/ comes an easy way to delegate OpenID server without hardcoding anything. For a while I'd been hardcoding the delegate in my header, but this a much cleaner way. Install the plugin, fill in the few fields in the admin section and you're done! I'm hoping to change my layout soon, so the less I have hardcoded the better. This should be a must have plugin for Wordpress.
