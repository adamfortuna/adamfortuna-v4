If you're an Adobe developer in central Florida, make sure to check out the newly created "Adobe Developers of Greater Orlando":http://adogo.us/ Usergroup. The focus of the group will be on Adobe languages and issues facing developers in general. Please check it out and sign up if you're interested. Topics listed there are a recap of what we discussed in the previous pre-meeting last week, and although nothing has been finalized we are making great strides towards having an active usergroup in Orlando once again.
