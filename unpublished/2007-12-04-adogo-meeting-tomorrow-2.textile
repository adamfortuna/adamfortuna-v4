If you're in or around the Orlando area tomorrow night, consider stopping into the December "Adogo":http://adogo.us/ meeting from 7pm-8:30pm at Devry by Mall at Millenia. Luis Majano will be presenting remotely on ColdBox, followed by a birds of a feather session on ColdFusion frameworks led by "Brian LeGros":http://www.brianlegros.com . If you've never been to a BOF (as they're called) they're basically a discussion with one person (or more) managing the room and spurring on conversation. In addition we'll be giving away a ColdFusion 8 standard license to one random person.
